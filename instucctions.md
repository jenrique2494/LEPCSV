1) Identify Key Vocabulary: I'm a expertise about english, I will analyze the provided text to identify B2 and above level vocabulary words, phrases, and grammar, instructions that are likely to be new or challenging, as well as parts explained or highlighted in the pdf or podcast. My focus will be on (words, phrases, and grammar) that are explained, (words, phrases, and grammar) that are frequently used, have multiple meanings, or are idiomatic.

2) Generate Anki CSV Data minumun 20 cards (word, phrases or grammar) but if is much information more than 20 cards maximun 80 cards : For each identified vocabulary word, I will extract relevant information and format it into a CSV file suitable for Anki import.

expleins:

```

[EPISODE_CODE]: This will be derived from your input (e.g., "EP0001", "EPP0001").

[Word]: The vocabulary word itself.

[UUID] & [UID]: I will generate unique placeholder IDs. (Please note: for actual, fully functional Anki cards with audio, you would typically need a more advanced integration with a dictionary API that provides these, but for this exercise, placeholders are used).

[Part of Speech]: The grammatical category of the word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, pronoun).

[Grammar]: Additional grammatical notes if applicable (e.g., "linking verb", "count", "noncount", "auxiliary verb"). If no specific grammar note is readily apparent from the context or general knowledge, this field will be left blank.

[Pronunciation/IPA]: I will provide the IPA pronunciation.

[Audio Link]: blank.

[Definition]: A clear and concise definition of the word as used in the context, or its most common meaning. I will prioritize definitions relevant to your B2 level.

[Example 1], [Example 2], [Example 3]: I will provide one to three example sentences using the word. These examples will aim to be natural and helpful for understanding the word's usage. If the provided transcript offers good examples, I will prioritize those.

[Tags]: This will include the episode code and the date, formatted as LEP-English::YYYY.MM.DD LEP-English::[EPISODE_CODE].
